software design document
1._Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_
Client: The Gaming Room.
Software Requirements: The client wanted to design a cross-platform game application similar to their existing web-based game, "Draw It or Lose It." The software needed to run on multiple devices, including web, Android, and iOS, support multiple game instances.

2._What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_
Scalability: The design accounted for future scalability and modularity, allowing for easy updates and expansions.

3._What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_
Requirement Analysis: It facilitated a deeper understanding of the requirements, ensuring all critical features were considered and planned for.

4._If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_

5._How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_
Interpretation and Implementation: Users needed a cross-platform game that is easy to use, engaging, and supports real-time interaction. These needs were translated into specific features such as cross-platform compatibility, real-time updates, intuitive UI, and robust user authentication systems.
Importance: Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software is user-friendly, meets expectations, and provides a satisfying experience, which ultimately leads to higher user retention and success of the application.

6._How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_
System Design: Develop a high-level system architecture outlining major components and their interactions.
Modularity: Design the system in a modular way to allow for easy updates and maintenance.
Prototyping: Create prototypes and seek feedback early in the design process.
Iterative Development: Use an iterative development approach, continuously refining and improving the design based on feedback and testing.
Agile Methodology: Employ agile methodology for flexibility and continuous improvement.
Comprehensive Testing: Implement thorough testing strategies, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the software is reliable and meets quality standards.
